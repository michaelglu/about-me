                After the team underwent a reorg and was tasked with exploring a
                new OpenXR style data model for AR, performed initial
                investigations into the current Mixed Reality stack. Designed
                and got alignment on the first demo architecture. Collaborated
                on the development of the demo app. Designed and got alignment
                on long-term architecture that would allow current and
                experimental data models to coexist in a safe manner.

                This project invlolved building brand-new testing and evaluation
                infrastructure, productionizing a new ML model, profiling

                into the Spark stack. Integrations involved changes in C++

                Landed new internal tooling for A/B testing. The simplified UI
                of the new tool greatly sped up model rollouts as ML engineers
                were able to use the tool themselves with minimal assistance
                from our team. <br /><br />
                Collaborated on ARKit/ARCore slam data record/replay infra that

              <p>
                Over the course of my internship I built a sample Android
                application to test whether Facebook’s internal GraphQL library
                is ready for internal open sourcing to all family of apps
                products, and showcase best practices. While working on this
                app, I debugged and added new features to GraphQL Build time
                library written in JavaScript, GraphQL Runtime library written
                in C++ and server stack written in PHP/Hack. I also added and
                modified code generation scripts to make developer experience
                easier for product teams. Finally, I fixed team’s documentation
                problems by updating their internal and external documentation.

                internship, I added new features to Facebook’s Automated Ads

                build in new API endpoints. Additionally, I added new features

                My research explored the relatively new trends in Virtual
                Reality aiming to bring down cost of entry for developers and
                consumers. Mainly, I focused on WebVR and Oculus Go. Over the
                course of the year, I built a real-time multi-user VR experience
                using WebVR and native Oculus development to compare the
                tradeoffs between the two platforms. The API is built in NodeJS
                with SocketIO for realtime messaging. The WebVR client is built
                using AFrame, and the native client is built using Unity Oculus
                SDK. Real time audio communication is enabled by WebRTC.

              <p>
                Over the year I explored current capabilities and limitations of
                Google's ARCore and ways in which a regular product developer
                could overcome them. In the first project, I built a multi-user
                AR Experience that did not rely on ARCore Cloud Anchors feature
                and bypassed the 24-hour time limit imposed by Google. REST API
                was built with MERN stack and the client was an ARCore enabled
                Android app.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second project that year focused on building a Cloud Storage
                API for ARCore’s Augmented Images that enabled creation of
                code-free AR Experiences by having the app load images and 3D
                assets at runtime. The research was published in an invited paper 
                at PerCom 2020 SmartEdge Workshop.

                Over the couse of the co-op I developed and fully integrated an

                When the company was considering redesigning the app to work
